# Målerjakt ("moth hunt") app
A citizen science initiative for mapping of an invasive species.

We present a new outreach activity based on citizen science. The goal of the project is to engage volunteer observers of all ages in a campaign to map the current distribution of scarce umber moth, a forest pest species that is currently spreading into northern Norway. The spread of the species as far as Tromsø has been documented by research, but its continued spread north and east of Tromsø is unknown. The scarce umber moth possesses a number of important qualities that make it a good target for citizen science. Through development of a targeted app for smart phones and tablets, and a dedicated campaign during the autumn of 2017, we hope to engage schoolchildren, as well as the public in Troms and Finnmark in recording the presence of the species in their neighborhood.

## Geographical localization of the fieldwork/work (in decimal degrees, max 5 per project)
Northern Norway, but primarily Troms and Finnmark Counties. Example coordinates: Tromsø: 69.64° N, 18.95° E, Kautokeino: 69.01° N, 23.04° E, Alta: 69.95° N, 23.33° E.

## The scarce umber moth (Agriopis aurantiaria) as a target for citizen science
The scarce umber moth is in many ways an ideal target for citizen science. Spectacular outbreaks by geometrid moth (or ‘lauvmakk’ as is the local term in northern Norway) are a well-known phenomenon to most inhabitants in the region. In contrast to the duller appearance of the other two, more well researched, mass occurring moth species, the scarce umber moth males are of a bright golden colour, and both easy to spot and distinct from all other species in the region. There is hence a fairly low risk of mis-identification, which is otherwise a common concern in citizen science projects. Furthermore, the males are strongly phototactic, which means that they tend to aggregate near garden lights or brightly lit windows. We can utilize this behaviour in citizen science by creating simple protocols for monitoring outdoor lights in private gardens, kindergartens or schoolyards.

## Goals of the project
The overarching goal of the project is to engage volunteer observers in a campaign to map the current distribution of scarce umber moth. In doing so, we hope to achieve a number of sub-goals:
- 1) To obtain an up-to-date overview of scarce umber moth presences north and east of the known front of spread of the species.
- 2) To provide teachers with a low threshold opportunity for engaging school children in a practical educational activity which will contribute to generating real data.
- 3) To provide a simple, fun and hands-on way of engaging the public in science, and through that influence public awareness and attitudes towards science.
- 4) To gain valuable in-house experience in how simple apps can be designed and used in targeted surveys of biodiversity.
